 * The row above every page's H1 that hands the page to a language model.
 *
 * Two things a reader cannot do on their own. Copying what they see gives them the rendered page —
 * the navigation, the copy buttons inside the code blocks, the syntax-highlighting spans. The
 * Markdown twin this site already generates is the same page without any of that, and this is the
 * control that reaches it.
 *
 * Two menus rather than one, and neither trigger does anything but open its own: what the reader
 * wants is either the file or a model, and asking that question first keeps each menu short enough
 * to read at a glance. It also means no click acts before the reader has said which of the two they
 * meant.
 *
 * The four services are a convenience over one action, not the action itself. `Copy` carries the
 * content and depends on nobody: it serves a local model, a chat with egress blocked, a paste into
 * an editor, and every service not listed here. The links depend on the model fetching a URL, which
 * is usually fine and occasionally fails by inventing an answer instead of admitting it read
 * nothing — so `Copy` leads its menu.
 *
 * Registered once in the theme's `doc-before` slot, so it covers every page without a line in any
 * of them.
