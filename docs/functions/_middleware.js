/**
 * Content negotiation: serve Markdown to clients that ask for it, HTML to everyone else.
 *
 * An agent reading this site through a browser page pays for a layout it cannot use — navigation,
 * theme switcher, search widget, syntax-highlighting spans — to reach prose that was Markdown
 * before the build touched it. `Accept: text/markdown` gets that prose back.
 *
 * What it returns is the *source*, not a conversion of the rendered HTML. The build already has the
 * better answer: the Markdown the page was written in, with the site's components resolved into the
 * links and headings they render as.
 *
 * The twin files come from `.vitepress/llms.mjs` at build time, one per page, at the page's own
 * path with `.md` appended: `/reference/cli` → `/reference/cli.md`, `/guides/` → `/guides.md`. They
 * are ordinary assets, so an agent that would rather not negotiate can just request them, and every
 * HTML page advertises its own with a `Link: … rel="alternate"` header and a matching `<link>` in
 * the document head.
 *
 * Anything without a twin falls through to HTML. A page that exists in one representation and 404s
 * in the other would be worse than never having offered the choice.
